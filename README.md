quorra is an isometric grid engine that works with tetrahedral and hexagonal
grids. It is designed to be easy used with any game engine. Simply plug in a
tile size, isometric ratio, and grid size; then recieve pixel coordinates for
placement of objects.

I built it after not being able to find a non-commercial javascript hex-grid
library after lots of searching. Let's build something awesome and open-source.
